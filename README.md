# SWARMPLAYER
#### Created by Basil Regi


## How to run:

The zip file containing the source code for the project
should also contain an executable SwarmPlayer.jar file which you 
can simply click to run. If this does not work, the source code
can be run by opening the project in any Java IDE and running
SwarmPlayer.java class. 

*Note: SwarmPlayer was only tested on a Macbook, so functionality
may not work on other systems*

In case of lag when running the visualisation, I have also included 
a SwarmPlayer(Reduced).jar file  which uses less boids for the 
simulation.

Once the application is loaded, you can load an audio file using
the 'Load' button. The 4 short excerpts of music used for the 
evaluation of SwarmPlayer is provided in the folder 'Test Music'.
Once a file is loaded in, you can start/pause the audio and 
visualisation using the Start button and clear the whole
visualisation and audio using the Reset button. The Swarm Mixer
button brings up a window which allows you to control certain 
values in the swarm simulation.
